// What class User {...} construct really does is:

// Creates a function named User, that becomes the result of the class declaration. 
// The function code is taken from the constructor method (assumed empty if we donâ€™t write such method).
// Stores class methods, such as sayHi, in User.prototype.


console.log(User.prototype); // Empty object
// IMPORTANT
/*
Node.js prints only properties of the object that are enumerable
That means console.log() will print the properties that are it's own and they can be iterated

* By default, class methods are non-enumerable, they are not shown in console.log()
To display the members of the class we user Object.getOwnPropertyNames method


During the declaration of methods JavaScript does something like this:
Object.defineProperty(User.prototype, 'sayHi', {
  value: function() { console.log("Hi"); },
  enumerable: false
});

That means, Property is there, but it is hidden when object is accessed
To access the property, we need to specifically call the property
*/

console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(User.prototype));
